			<p><strong>Do away with the Iron: </strong>Ironing is not enjoyable to everyone. Khwiz Laundry professional finishing means clothing get a wrinkle-free and new look appearance.</p>
			<p><strong>Removal of Stains: </strong>We use multifaceted procedures and special stain removal chemicals to remove stains. There are two major categories: solvent-soluble stains and water-soluble stains. These different stains require different treatments, which our stain removal technicians are trained to administer.</p>
			<p><strong>Fabric Care: </strong>Each fabric requires a different kind of laundering treatment. We have this knowledge and apply our skills to care best for the clothing we receive.</p>
			<p><strong>Long Lasting Clothes: </strong>Regular dry cleaning can prolong the life of certain clothing because clothing is being treated and cared for professionally and accordingly. Dry cleaning your clothing regularly helps you to protect your clothes and inevitably your appearance.</p>
			<p><strong>Avoid Shrinkage: </strong>Shrinkage is the most common reason why good clothing is destroyed. Dry cleaning avoids any shrinkage of any form.</p>

			<p><strong>Safeguards from Moths: </strong>Cleaned clothing prevents moth and other insect damage. Insects can damage clothes through direct damage which is caused by a group of insects feeding directly on a fabric and indirect damage is caused by insects as they feed on spilled food or perspiration on the fabric. Moths attack the clothing directly, especially wool and wool blends.</p>
